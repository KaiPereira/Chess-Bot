# PyBot V1

A python chess engine built ontop of the lichess uci api!

This engine uses a logic based engine instead of a neural network. 

It uses a few different things to consider moves:
- Piece positions
- Material value
- Evaluation of pieces: https://www.chessprogramming.org/Evaluation_of_Pieces (many of these)

It's still in development but growing strong, it's beaten stockfish 4 (1700 elo) so far so doing good!

If you want to build your own, the https://www.chessprogramming.org/ was very helpful!
